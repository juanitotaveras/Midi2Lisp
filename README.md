# Midi2Lisp
This program gets MIDI text and compiles into music that you can play with JFugue

# Getting MIDI to text
First go to this site http://valentin.dasdeck.com/midi/mid2txt.php and upload your MIDI file.
It will convert it to text, which you can feed into Midi2List.java.

# Using Midi2Lisp
Example: java Midi2Lisp mario.txt mario_lisp.txt

# Note
Make SURE Midi2Lisp is in the same folder as your Cons.java file.
